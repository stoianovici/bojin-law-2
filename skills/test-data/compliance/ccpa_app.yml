  sections:
    - Executive summary with compliance score
    - Consumer rights implementation analysis
    - Notice and disclosure findings
    - Data sale and sharing assessment
    - Sensitive data handling (CPRA provisions)
    - Gap analysis and remediation plan
  compliance_score_range: "0-100%"

known_compliance_gaps:
  HIGH_PRIORITY:
    - Health data is "sensitive personal information" under CPRA - requires opt-in consent and separate notice
    - Advertising partners likely constitute "sale" - must implement Do Not Sell/Share link
    - Location data sharing with equipment manufacturers may require separate consent
    - No evidence of "Right to Delete" implementation in technical architecture
  MEDIUM_PRIORITY:
    - Privacy policy must itemize all third parties (currently generic "partners")
    - Notice at collection timing unclear (must be at/before data collection)
    - Authorized agent process not documented
  LOW_PRIORITY:
    - Privacy policy should include CPRA-specific updates (retention periods, sensitive PI)
    - Consumer request verification procedures need documentation

expected_recommendations:
  - Implement prominent "Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information" toggle
  - Add Do Not Sell/Share link to app settings
  - Create consumer request portal for access/deletion
  - Update privacy policy with all third-party data recipients listed by name
  - Implement technical delete functionality (anonymize or purge within 45 days)
  - Add notice at collection when health data first synced
  - Conduct data inventory and mapping exercise
  - Execute Data Processing Agreements with all third parties

success_criteria:
  - Identifies health data as sensitive PI requiring special treatment
  - Flags ad networks as potential "sale" of data
  - Recommends Do Not Sell implementation
  - Addresses CPRA-specific requirements (vs. original CCPA)
  - Provides actionable remediation steps with priority levels

performance_targets:
  token_usage: <2500 tokens
  execution_time: <7 seconds
