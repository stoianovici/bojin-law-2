expected_output:
  format: "HIPAA Compliance Assessment"
  sections:
    - Executive summary with risk level
    - BAA and business associate status
    - Technical safeguards analysis
    - Administrative safeguards analysis
    - Physical safeguards analysis
    - Breach response readiness
    - Subcontractor chain compliance
    - Remediation plan with timeline
  risk_level: "HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW"

known_compliance_gaps:
  CRITICAL:
    - Audit logs only retained 90 days (HIPAA requires 6 years)
    - No documented risk assessment conducted in last 12 months
    - No evidence of Business Associate Agreements with AWS or payment processor
    - Encryption algorithm not specified (must be FIPS 140-2 compliant)
  HIGH:
    - No formal breach notification policy/procedure
    - Access logs don't capture patient-specific access (minimum necessary auditing)
    - No workforce training documentation
    - Disaster recovery plan not tested in last 12 months
  MEDIUM:
    - MFA only for admin, not all workforce members accessing ePHI
    - No documented policies for granting/revoking access
    - Physical security for backup media not documented
  LOW:
    - Privacy notice not prominently displayed in application
    - Patient rights request process not clearly documented

expected_recommendations:
  IMMEDIATE (0-30 days):
    - Execute BAAs with AWS and payment processor
    - Extend audit log retention to 6 years
    - Document and implement breach notification procedures (60-day notification requirement)
    - Conduct comprehensive risk assessment per 45 CFR § 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A)
  SHORT-TERM (30-90 days):
    - Implement annual HIPAA training program with completion tracking
    - Expand MFA requirement to all workforce members
    - Create and test disaster recovery/business continuity plan
    - Document all policies and procedures (required by 45 CFR § 164.316)
  ONGOING:
    - Annual risk assessments
    - Quarterly policy reviews
    - Penetration testing (annual minimum)
    - Incident response drills

success_criteria:
  - Identifies 6-year audit log retention requirement
  - Flags missing BAAs as critical compliance gap
  - Addresses both Security Rule and Privacy Rule requirements
  - Recommends risk assessment as foundational requirement
  - Provides timeline-based remediation plan
  - Notes encryption must be NIST/FIPS compliant

performance_targets:
  token_usage: <3000 tokens
  execution_time: <8 seconds
