# Executive Summary Template

## Purpose

Generate a concise, stakeholder-friendly summary of contract analysis findings suitable for executives, managers, or non-legal team members.

## Structure

### Opening Statement (1-2 sentences)

Provide immediate context:

- Contract type and parties
- Overall risk assessment
- Key recommendation (sign/revise/reject)

**Examples:**

- "This Service Agreement between CompanyA and VendorB presents **MEDIUM RISK** with 3 missing critical clauses. Recommend revisions before execution."
- "The proposed NDA is **LOW RISK** and well-balanced. Recommend execution with minor clarifications."
- "This Employment Agreement contains **HIGH RISK** terms including an unenforceable non-compete. Recommend substantial renegotiation."

### Key Findings (3-5 bullet points)

Highlight most important discoveries:

- Critical missing clauses
- Significant risk exposure
- One-sided or unusual terms
- Major compliance concerns

**Format:**

- 🔴 [HIGH RISK finding with specific impact]
- 🟡 [MEDIUM RISK finding with specific impact]
- ✅ [Positive finding or strength]

**Examples:**

- 🔴 **No liability cap**: Unlimited exposure for breach (could exceed $5M)
- 🟡 **30-day auto-renewal**: Contract extends automatically without opt-out notice
- ✅ **Strong IP protection**: Clear ownership allocation with comprehensive licensing terms

### Business Impact (1 paragraph)

Translate legal risks into business consequences:

- Financial exposure
- Operational constraints
- Strategic implications
- Timeline considerations

**Example:**
"The unlimited liability clause exposes the company to potential losses far exceeding the $100K contract value. The 180-day notice requirement for termination prevents agile vendor management. However, the strong IP provisions ensure full ownership of deliverables, supporting the product development roadmap."

### Immediate Action Required (numbered list)

Specific next steps prioritized by urgency:

1. **[CRITICAL]** [Action with deadline]
2. **[IMPORTANT]** [Action with timeline]
3. **[RECOMMENDED]** [Optional improvement]

**Examples:**

1. **[CRITICAL]** Negotiate liability cap before execution (must-have term)
2. **[IMPORTANT]** Add force majeure clause covering pandemic/cyber events
3. **[RECOMMENDED]** Reduce termination notice from 180 to 90 days for flexibility

## Writing Guidelines

### Do's

✅ Use plain English, avoid legalese
✅ Quantify risks when possible ($amounts, percentages, timelines)
✅ Lead with business impact, not legal theory
✅ Provide specific, actionable recommendations
✅ Use visual indicators (emojis, formatting) for scannability
✅ Include confidence qualifiers when uncertain

### Don'ts

❌ Don't use legal jargon without explanation
❌ Don't list every minor issue (prioritize top 3-5)
❌ Don't provide vague recommendations like "review carefully"
❌ Don't make definitive legal conclusions (say "appears to" or "likely")
❌ Don't exceed 1 page for executive summary
❌ Don't hide critical risks in technical details

## Risk Level Definitions for Executives

**🟢 LOW RISK**

- Minor issues only
- Standard terms
- Balanced obligations
- **Action**: Can execute with confidence

**🟡 MEDIUM RISK**

- Some missing recommended clauses
- Minor one-sided terms
- Manageable exposure
- **Action**: Negotiate improvements before signing

**🔴 HIGH RISK**

- Missing critical protections
- Unreasonable obligations
- Significant liability exposure
- **Action**: Substantial renegotiation or reject

   - Specific $ amount or scenario

3. **"How does this compare to our standard agreement?"**
   - Highlight key deviations

4. **"What leverage do we have to negotiate?"**
   - Identify bargaining points

## Example Executive Summary

```markdown
## Executive Summary

This **Master Services Agreement** between Acme Corp and TechVendor Inc. presents **MEDIUM RISK** with notable gaps in liability protection and IP ownership. **Recommend revisions before execution.**

### Key Findings

- 🔴 **Unlimited Liability**: No cap on damages for breach (contract value: $500K, exposure: unlimited)
- 🟡 **Unclear IP Ownership**: Deliverables ownership not explicitly allocated to Acme
- 🟡 **180-Day Termination Notice**: Lengthy exit period limits vendor flexibility
- ✅ **Strong Confidentiality**: Robust NDA provisions protect proprietary information

### Business Impact

The unlimited liability clause exposes Acme to losses potentially exceeding $5M for a $500K engagement. The ambiguous IP terms risk disputes over ownership of critical software deliverables worth $2M+ in strategic value. The 180-day termination notice prevents agile vendor management if performance issues arise.

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **[CRITICAL]** Add $1M liability cap (2x contract value) - must-have before signing
2. **[IMPORTANT]** Clarify Acme owns all deliverables with IP assignment language
3. **[RECOMMENDED]** Reduce termination notice to 90 days for operational flexibility

### Overall Recommendation

**SIGN WITH REVISIONS** - Deal is favorable with the 3 changes above. If vendor rejects liability cap, escalate for executive decision.

**Confidence Level**: High - Standard service agreement structure with typical negotiable terms.
