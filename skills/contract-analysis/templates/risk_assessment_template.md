# Risk Assessment Template

## Risk Evaluation Framework

### Risk Categories

#### 1. CRITICAL RISKS (🔴 HIGH Priority)

**Missing Essential Clauses**
- **Risk**: Contract unenforceable or major liability exposure
- **Impact**: Legal disputes, financial loss, operational disruption
- **Mitigation**: Add missing clauses before execution

**Examples:**
- No governing law clause (jurisdictional uncertainty)
- Missing termination rights (contract perpetuity risk)
- No liability limitation (unlimited exposure)
- Absent indemnification (unprotected against third-party claims)

**Unlimited Liability**
- **Risk**: Exposure exceeds contract value
- **Impact**: Catastrophic financial loss
- **Mitigation**: Negotiate liability cap (typically 1-2x contract value)

**One-Sided Obligations**
- **Risk**: Unbalanced rights and responsibilities
- **Impact**: Unfair burden, difficult to enforce
- **Mitigation**: Request reciprocal obligations

**Ambiguous Material Terms**
- **Risk**: Differing interpretations lead to disputes
- **Impact**: Litigation, contract failure
- **Mitigation**: Clarify definitions and obligations

#### 2. SIGNIFICANT RISKS (🟡 MEDIUM Priority)

**Missing Recommended Clauses**
- **Risk**: Gap in contract coverage
- **Impact**: Unclear rights in specific scenarios
- **Mitigation**: Add recommended clauses

**Examples:**
- No force majeure (pandemic/disaster risk)
- Missing confidentiality (information leakage)
- No IP allocation (ownership disputes)
- Absent dispute resolution (litigation costs)

**Short Notice Periods**
- **Risk**: Insufficient time to wind down or transition
- **Impact**: Operational disruption
- **Mitigation**: Negotiate 30-90 day notice minimum

**Unclear IP Ownership**
- **Risk**: Disputed work product ownership
- **Impact**: Cannot use deliverables, litigation
- **Mitigation**: Explicit IP assignment or license

**Weak Warranties**
- **Risk**: No recourse for defective performance
- **Impact**: Loss without remedy
- **Mitigation**: Include specific warranties and remedies

**Auto-Renewal Without Notice**
- **Risk**: Unwanted contract extension
- **Impact**: Committed beyond intended term
- **Mitigation**: Require opt-in renewal or notice period

#### 3. MINOR RISKS (🟢 LOW Priority)

**Drafting Improvements**
- **Risk**: Minor ambiguity or inconsistency
- **Impact**: Potential confusion
- **Mitigation**: Clarify language in next revision

**Optional Clauses Not Included**
- **Risk**: Missing convenience provisions
- **Impact**: Minor operational inconvenience
- **Mitigation**: Consider adding in future amendments

**Standard Boilerplate Variations**
- **Risk**: Non-standard but acceptable language
- **Impact**: Minimal
- **Mitigation**: Monitor for industry changes

## Risk Scoring Matrix

| Factor | Weight | Score Range |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Missing Critical Clauses | 40% | 0-10 per missing clause |
| Liability Exposure | 30% | 0-30 based on cap |
| One-Sided Terms | 20% | 0-20 based on balance |
| Ambiguity Level | 10% | 0-10 based on clarity |

**Overall Risk Score Calculation:**
- **HIGH RISK**: Total score > 50
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Total score 25-50
- **LOW RISK**: Total score < 25

## Mitigation Strategies by Risk Type

### For Missing Clauses
1. Draft proposed clause language
2. Reference standard industry templates
3. Prioritize by criticality
4. Negotiate insertion before execution

### For Liability Issues
1. Propose liability caps (1-2x contract value)
2. Add carve-outs for gross negligence/willful misconduct
3. Ensure mutual indemnification
4. Consider insurance requirements

### For One-Sided Terms
1. Identify specific imbalanced provisions
2. Propose reciprocal language
3. Request mutual obligations
4. Escalate if not business-critical

### For Ambiguous Terms
1. Define key terms in definitions section
2. Add examples or illustrations
3. Cross-reference related provisions
4. Clarify intent through amendment

## Jurisdiction-Specific Risks

### California
- Non-compete clauses generally unenforceable
- Strong employee protections
- Strict wage payment requirements

### New York
- Enforces reasonable non-competes
- Strong contract enforcement
- Specific notice requirements for termination

### UK
- Unfair Contract Terms Act protections
- GDPR data processing requirements
- Different IP default rules

### EU
- GDPR compliance mandatory
- Consumer protection directives
- Cross-border jurisdiction complexity

## Contract Type-Specific Risks

### Service Agreements
- **Critical**: Payment terms, scope of work, deliverables, IP ownership
- **Watch for**: Unlimited scope creep, vague acceptance criteria

### Employment Agreements
- **Critical**: Termination rights, non-compete reasonableness, IP assignment
- **Watch for**: Overly broad restrictions, missing severance

### NDAs
- **Critical**: Definition of confidential info, exclusions, return/destruction
- **Watch for**: Perpetual obligations, overly broad definitions

### Purchase Agreements
- **Critical**: Price, delivery terms, acceptance criteria, warranties
- **Watch for**: Unlimited acceptance period, weak remedies
