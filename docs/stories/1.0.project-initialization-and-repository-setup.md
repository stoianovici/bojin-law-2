# Story 1.0: Project Initialization and Repository Setup

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** the project repository and foundation properly initialized,
**so that** all developers can start work with a consistent environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. GitHub repository created with proper .gitignore for Node.js/TypeScript
2. Monorepo initialized using Turborepo with folder structure:
   - /apps (web, api, admin)
   - /packages (ui, types, utils, ai-prompts)
   - /services (document, task, ai, integration, notification)
3. Initial README.md with project overview, architecture diagram, setup instructions
4. Git workflow configured with branch protection, PR template, commit conventions
5. Base package.json with workspaces configuration
6. LICENSE file and SECURITY.md added

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [x] Create comprehensive README.md including:
    - Project title and overview
    - Architecture diagram (embed mermaid diagram from architecture docs)
    - Prerequisites (Node.js 20+, pnpm)
    - Setup instructions (clone, install, run)
    - Repository structure explanation
    - Links to detailed architecture docs
  - [x] Ensure README includes reference to docs/architecture/ for full technical details

- [x] **Task 4: Configure Git Workflow and Standards** (AC: 4)

  - [x] Create .github/pull_request_template.md with sections for:
    - Description
    - Type of change (feature, bugfix, docs, etc.)
    - Testing performed
    - Checklist (linting, tests passing, documentation updated)
  - [x] Document commit conventions in CONTRIBUTING.md:
    - Follow conventional commits format (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
    - Reference issue/story numbers in commits
  - [x] Create .github/workflows directory for future CI/CD

- [x] **Task 5: Add LICENSE and Security Documentation** (AC: 6)

  - [x] Create SECURITY.md with:
    - Security policy statement
    - Vulnerability reporting process
    - Contact information for security issues
    - Note about handling sensitive legal data

- [ ] **Task 6: Verify Repository Setup**
  - [ ] Confirm all directories exist and are properly structured
  - [ ] Test that Turborepo commands work (pnpm build, pnpm dev)
  - [ ] Verify .gitignore is working correctly
  - [ ] Ensure README renders correctly on GitHub
  - [ ] Create final commit with message: "feat: initialize project repository and monorepo structure"

```

### Technology Stack Context
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Key Technologies for Repository Setup:**
- **Node.js**: Version 20 LTS required
- **TypeScript**: 5.3+ for type-safe development
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (configured in Turborepo)
- **Monorepo Tool**: Turborepo - optimal for Next.js projects, excellent caching, parallel execution
- **Build Tool**: Vite 5.0+ for frontend bundling
- **Testing**: Jest 29+ (will be configured in Story 1.2)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions + Azure DevOps

### Architecture Principles
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]

**Repository Organization Rationale:**
- **Monorepo Structure**: "Microservices within Monorepo" pattern balances modularity with development efficiency
- **Package Organization**:
  - `/apps` - Deployable applications (web frontend, admin portal)
  - `/packages` - Shared code (UI components, TypeScript types, utilities, AI prompts)
  - `/services` - Microservices (domain-driven service separation)
- **Why Turborepo**: Optimal for TypeScript monorepos, excellent caching reduces build times, parallel task execution

### Coding Standards for Repository
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Rules to Establish:**
- **Type Sharing**: All types must be defined in `packages/shared/types` (establish this structure now)
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Frontend components: PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`)
  - API routes: kebab-case (e.g., `/api/user-profile`)
  - Database tables: snake_case (e.g., `user_profiles`)

### Git Workflow Requirements
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]
Limited information available in architecture docs - use industry best practices for TypeScript monorepo projects.

**Recommended Git Configuration:**
- Branch protection on `main` requiring PR reviews
- Conventional commit format for clear changelog generation
- PR template to ensure consistent review process
- Security policy for handling vulnerability reports

### .gitignore Essentials
Must include:
- `node_modules/` - dependency directories
- `.env*` - environment variables (CRITICAL for security)
- `dist/`, `build/`, `.next/` - build outputs
- `coverage/` - test coverage reports
- `*.log` - log files
- `.DS_Store` - macOS files

### File Locations for This Story
- Root: `package.json`, `turbo.json`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md`
- `.github/`: `pull_request_template.md`, workflows directory
- Create all directories from unified-project-structure.md
- Do not populate services/apps yet - just create directory structure

### Technical Constraints
- Node.js version must be 20+ (LTS)
- Must use pnpm as package manager (not npm or yarn)
- TypeScript 5.3+ required
- All services will share types from `packages/shared/types`

### Testing

**Testing Standards for This Story:**
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

No automated tests required for Story 1.0 as this is infrastructure setup. Testing will be manual verification:
- Verify directory structure matches specification
- Confirm Turborepo commands execute successfully
- Validate .gitignore prevents sensitive files from being committed
- Ensure README renders correctly

**Note**: Story 1.2 will establish the full testing infrastructure (Jest, Playwright, etc.).

### Security Considerations
- SECURITY.md must emphasize handling of sensitive legal data
- .gitignore must prevent any .env files from being committed
- LICENSE should be reviewed with legal team (likely proprietary)
