# Story 1.15: Content Views Enrichment

**Epic**: 1 - UI Foundation & Interactive Prototype
**Story**: 1.15
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Review
**Dependencies**: 1.5, 1.6, 1.7
**Created**: 2025-11-18
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-18

---

## Story

**As a** law firm user
**I want** richer content previews and better navigation in Cases, Documents, and Tasks views
**So that** I can quickly find and understand information without unnecessary clicking

---

## Context

Three key content views need UX improvements to help users work more efficiently:

1. **Cases Overview**: Currently shows minimal information, requiring users to click into each case to understand its status and details
2. **Documents View**: Large number of documents with no sorting/filtering makes it hard to find specific files
3. **Tasks Calendar**: Has two competing prototypes with a selector, creating confusion

These views are frequently accessed and improving them will significantly boost daily productivity.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Richer Cases Overview

**Given** a user navigates to the Cases view
**When** the case list/grid loads
**Then** each case card MUST display the following information without requiring a click:

**Required Fields**:

- Case title/name
- Client name
- Case type (e.g., Civil, Criminal, Corporate)
- Current status (e.g., Active, Pending, Closed)
- Assigned attorney(s)
- Last activity date
- Next deadline (if any)
- Case priority indicator (high/medium/low)

**Visual Design**:

- Use color coding for status (green=active, yellow=pending, gray=closed)
- Highlight urgent deadlines (within 7 days) in red/orange
- Show attorney avatars for quick visual recognition
- Provide hover state with additional quick stats (# of documents, # of tasks)

**Interaction**:

- Clicking anywhere on card opens full case details
- Preserve current routing behavior
- Add quick actions menu (3-dot menu): "Add Task", "Upload Document", "Mark Complete"

### AC2: Document Browsing & Sorting

**Given** a user navigates to the Documents view
**When** the document list loads
**Then** the user MUST have the following capabilities:

**Sorting Options** (via dropdown or column headers):

- Date uploaded (newest/oldest)
- Document name (A-Z, Z-A)
- File type (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- File size (largest/smallest)
- Related case (alphabetically)
- Last modified date

**Filtering Options** (via sidebar or top bar):

- By case (multi-select dropdown)
- By document type (Contract, Brief, Correspondence, etc.)
- By upload date range (date picker)
- By attorney who uploaded
- By file type (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, etc.)

**Search**:

- Search box for document name/content search
- Real-time filtering as user types
- Clear all filters button

**Display Enhancements**:

- Show document preview thumbnail (if available)
- Display file size and page count
- Show associated case name
- Indicate if document has been reviewed/signed
- Display last modified timestamp

**UX Features**:

- Remember user's last sort preference (localStorage)
- Show result count: "Showing 45 of 230 documents"
- Infinite scroll or pagination (recommend pagination for performance)
- Bulk actions: Select multiple → Download as ZIP, Move to Case, etc.

### AC3: Simplified Task Calendar View

**Given** a user navigates to the Tasks view and selects Calendar
**When** the calendar view loads
**Then** only "Prototip v2" calendar implementation MUST be visible
**And** the prototype selector component MUST be removed entirely
**And** "Prototip v2" becomes the default and only calendar view

**Requirements**:

- Remove any UI elements related to prototype selection
- Clean up code to remove unused "Prototip v1" implementation
- Ensure all calendar features work as expected in v2
- Update any documentation or help text referencing old selector
- Verify routing still works correctly

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### AC1: Cases Overview - Files to Modify

```
apps/web/src/components/cases/
├── CasesView.tsx                  # Main cases list view
├── CaseCard.tsx                   # Individual case card component
├── CaseCardSkeleton.tsx           # Loading state
└── types/
    └── case.types.ts              # Add new fields to Case interface

apps/web/src/lib/
└── api/
    └── cases.api.ts               # Ensure API returns all needed fields
```

**Data Model Updates**:

```typescript
interface CaseOverview {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  clientName: string;
  caseType: 'Civil' | 'Criminal' | 'Corporate' | 'Family' | 'Real Estate';
  status: 'Active' | 'Pending' | 'On Hold' | 'Closed';
  assignedAttorneys: Attorney[];
  lastActivityDate: Date;
  nextDeadline?: Date;
  priority: 'High' | 'Medium' | 'Low';
  // Hover stats
  documentCount?: number;
  taskCount?: number;
}
```

**Design Tokens** (add to design system):

```css
--status-active: #10b981; /* Green */
--status-pending: #f59e0b; /* Amber */
--status-on-hold: #6b7280; /* Gray */
--status-closed: #9ca3af; /* Light Gray */
--priority-high: #ef4444; /* Red */
--priority-medium: #f59e0b; /* Amber */
--priority-low: #3b82f6; /* Blue */
--deadline-urgent: #dc2626; /* Dark Red */
```

### AC2: Documents View - Files to Modify

```
apps/web/src/components/documents/
├── DocumentsView.tsx              # Main view with filters
├── DocumentList.tsx               # Document grid/list
├── DocumentCard.tsx               # Individual document card
├── DocumentFilters.tsx            # NEW: Filter sidebar
├── DocumentSortMenu.tsx           # NEW: Sort dropdown
└── DocumentSearchBar.tsx          # NEW: Search component

apps/web/src/stores/
└── documents.store.ts             # Add filter/sort state
```

**State Management**:

```typescript
interface DocumentsState {
  documents: Document[];
  filters: {
    cases: string[];
    types: string[];
    dateRange: { start: Date; end: Date } | null;
    uploadedBy: string[];
    fileTypes: string[];
    searchQuery: string;
  };
  sortBy: 'date' | 'name' | 'type' | 'size' | 'case';
  sortOrder: 'asc' | 'desc';
  pagination: {
    page: number;
    perPage: number;
    total: number;
  };
}
```

**Implementation Strategy**:

1. Backend API must support filtering/sorting (or implement client-side if dataset is small <1000 docs)
2. Use React Query for caching and optimistic updates
3. Debounce search input (300ms delay)
4. Store filter preferences in localStorage
5. URL params for shareable filtered views (`/documents?case=123&sort=date-desc`)

### AC3: Task Calendar Simplification - Files to Modify

```
apps/web/src/components/tasks/
├── TaskCalendarView.tsx           # Remove selector, keep only v2
├── PrototypeSelector.tsx          # DELETE this component
└── calendar/
    ├── CalendarV2.tsx             # Rename to Calendar.tsx
    └── CalendarV1.tsx             # DELETE this component
```

**Steps**:

1. Remove `PrototypeSelector` component and all imports
2. Rename `CalendarV2` to `Calendar`
3. Update routing to point directly to Calendar component
4. Remove any state/props related to prototype selection
5. Clean up unused code and dependencies
6. Update tests to only test Calendar (v2)

---

## Design Mockups Needed

Before implementation, design team should provide:

- **Cases Overview**: Desktop and mobile layouts for enriched case cards
- **Documents View**: Filter sidebar layout, sort dropdown placement
- **Responsive behavior**: How filters collapse on mobile

(Can proceed with implementation using existing design system if mockups unavailable, with design review before merge)

---

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

**Cases**:

```typescript
describe('CaseCard', () => {
  it('should display all required case information', () => {});
  it('should highlight urgent deadlines', () => {});
  it('should show correct status color', () => {});
  it('should render attorney avatars', () => {});

---

## User Impact

**Severity**: High (affects daily workflow)
**User Value**: Very High (significant productivity improvement)
**Effort**: Large (16-24 hours)

### Before

- Cases: Must click into each case to see basic info
- Documents: Hard to find specific documents in large lists
- Tasks: Confusing prototype selector

### After

- Cases: See all relevant info at a glance

---

## Performance Considerations

### Cases Overview

- Lazy load attorney avatars
- Virtualize list if >100 cases (use `react-window`)
- Cache case overview data (5 min TTL)

### Documents View

- **Critical**: Pagination is essential for 500+ documents
- Implement infinite scroll OR traditional pagination
- Debounce search input (300ms)
- Server-side filtering for large datasets
- Consider indexing for fast search (Algolia, ElasticSearch, or simple DB index)

### Metrics to Monitor

- Time to First Contentful Paint (FCP): < 1.5s
- Time to Interactive (TTI): < 3s
- Filter/Sort response time: < 200ms
- Search debounce effectiveness: 50% reduction in API calls

---

- Bulk case operations (assign, close, etc.)
- Custom fields per case type
- Case timeline visualization

**Documents**:

- Document tags/categories
- AI-powered document categorization
- OCR search within PDFs
- Document comparison tool
- Version history view

**Tasks**:

- Multiple calendar views (day/week/month)
- Calendar sharing/export
- Recurring task templates

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise after deployment:

1. **Immediate**: Feature flags for each sub-feature
   - `feature.cases.enriched_view`
   - `feature.documents.filtering`
   - `feature.tasks.calendar_v2_only`

2. **Within 4 hours**: Git revert if feature flags insufficient

3. **Communication**: In-app notification to users about rollback

**Risk Level**: Medium-High

- Affects three major features used daily
- Data model changes for cases
- Performance risk with document filtering

**Mitigation**:

- Gradual rollout with feature flags
- Load testing with realistic data volumes
- Pilot firm testing before general release
- Monitoring dashboards for performance metrics

---

## Data Migration

**Cases**:

- If adding new fields to case model, ensure database migration script
- Backfill existing cases with default values for new fields
- Test migration on staging with production data snapshot

**Documents**:

- No data migration needed (only view changes)
- Verify API returns all needed fields for filtering

**Tasks**:

- No data migration (only removing UI component)

---

## Stakeholder Communication

**Pilot Firm**:

- Demo enriched cases view for feedback
- Gather input on which document filters are most valuable
- Confirm calendar v2 meets all needs before removing selector

**Development Team**:

- Backend team: Coordinate API changes for cases/documents
- Design team: Finalize mockups for cases and documents
- QA team: Extra attention to performance with large datasets

---

## Success Metrics

Track post-launch (via analytics):

**Cases**:

- Reduction in clicks to view case details (target: 30% reduction)
- Time to find specific case (target: < 10 seconds)
- Quick actions usage rate

**Documents**:

- Filter adoption rate (target: 60% of users)
- Time to find specific document (target: < 15 seconds)
- Search usage vs. manual browsing

**Tasks**:

- User confusion reports (target: 0 support tickets about selector)
- Calendar feature usage (ensure v2 covers all use cases)

---

## Notes

- This is the most complex of the three UI fix stories
- Consider splitting into 3 separate stories if timeline is tight:
  - 1.15.1: Cases Overview Enhancement
  - 1.15.2: Documents Filtering & Sorting
  - 1.15.3: Task Calendar Simplification
- Highest user value of all UI improvement stories
- Recommend prioritizing documents filtering (most requested by users)
