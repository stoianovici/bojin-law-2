# Story 2.1.1: Migrate Infrastructure from Azure to Render.com

## Status

Ready for Implementation (comprehensive cost analysis complete, migration plan approved)

## Story

**As a** platform operator,
**I want** to migrate from Azure AKS/Kubernetes infrastructure to Render.com PaaS,
**so that** we reduce infrastructure costs by 83% ($11,784/year savings), eliminate DevOps overhead, and accelerate time-to-market.

## Business Justification

**Current State (Azure):**

- Projected annual cost: $14,268/year (after optimizations)
- DevOps effort: 20 hours/month ($2,000/month at $100/hr)
- Time to deploy: 6-8 weeks
- Complexity: Kubernetes, Terraform, Azure DevOps, manual scaling

**Future State (Render):**

- Projected annual cost: $2,484/year
- DevOps effort: 5 hours/month ($500/month)
- Time to deploy: 3-5 days
- Complexity: Git push to deploy, auto-scaling, managed services

**3-Year TCO Comparison:**

- Azure: $114,804 (infra + DevOps)
- Render: $40,200 (infra + DevOps)
- **Savings: $74,604 over 3 years**

**Critical Finding:** Monitoring costs on Azure are 900% higher than industry standard ($1,782/month vs $200/month). Render includes monitoring at no additional cost.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Cost analysis complete comparing Azure vs Render vs alternatives (AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean)
2. All Azure-specific infrastructure files removed (Terraform, Kubernetes manifests, Azure DevOps pipelines)
3. Render configuration created (render.yaml with all services defined)
4. Dockerfiles optimized for Render deployment (multi-stage builds, health checks)
5. GitHub Actions updated to deploy via Render hooks (remove ACR publishing)
6. Environment variable documentation updated for Render (DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL auto-injection)
7. Infrastructure documentation rewritten for Render deployment model
8. Local development environment updated to mirror Render architecture
9. Migration scripts and helper tools created (deploy, logs, shell, backup, restore)
10. Integration tests validate Render deployment (all services healthy, DB connected, Redis working)
11. Cost estimation updated with actual Render pricing ($207/month production)
12. Staging environment deployed and validated on Render
13. Production environment deployed with zero downtime
14. Monitoring configured (New Relic free tier or Render native monitoring)
15. All team members trained on Render platform and deployment workflows

## Dev Notes

### Context: Infrastructure Simplification and Cost Optimization

This story represents a strategic pivot from Azure AKS/Kubernetes infrastructure to Render.com Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). This decision is made **before** deploying any infrastructure, allowing us to avoid migration costs and complexity.

### Business Case

**Cost Analysis Summary:**

| Metric                        | Azure (Projected) | Render   | Savings          |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| **Monthly Production**        | $1,189            | $207     | $982/mo (83%)    |
| **Annual Cost**               | $14,268           | $2,484   | $11,784/year     |
| **3-Year TCO (incl. DevOps)** | $114,804          | $40,200  | $74,604 (65%)    |
| **DevOps Hours/Month**        | 20 hours          | 5 hours  | 15 hours saved   |
| **Time to Deploy**            | 6-8 weeks         | 3-5 days | 5-7 weeks faster |

**Key Findings from Cost Analysis:**

1. **Monitoring Costs Anomaly:** Azure monitoring projected at $1,782/month (43% of total budget) vs industry standard $200/month. Render includes monitoring at no additional cost.

2. **Over-Provisioning:** Azure estimates assumed 8 AKS nodes on day 1, which is excessive for a legal platform expected to serve 100-1,000 users initially.

3. **DevOps Overhead:** Kubernetes/Terraform requires 20+ hours/month management vs 5 hours/month for Render.

4. **Complexity Tax:** Azure setup requires Terraform, Kubernetes, Azure DevOps, manual scaling, and expertise in all these technologies.

Total: $207/month
```

**Staging Environment ($52/month):**

- Same services but smaller instances (1GB RAM)
- Fewer replicas (1 instance per service)
- Smaller database (10GB)

### Migration Strategy

**Timeline:**

- Week 1: Clean up Azure files, create Render config (Tasks 1-5)
- Week 2: Update CI/CD and documentation (Tasks 6-13)
- Week 3: Update app config, create scripts (Tasks 14-18)
- Week 4: Testing and deployment (Tasks 19-24)

**Risk Mitigation:**

- All Azure docs archived (can reference if needed)
- Render trial period to validate approach
- Can rollback by reverting git commits
- No data exists yet (no migration complexity)

**Success Metrics:**

- [ ] Staging deployed in <5 days
- [ ] Production deployed in <7 days
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Costs within $207/month ±10%
- [ ] Team can deploy independently
- [ ] Zero unplanned downtime

### Render Platform Evaluation

**Pros:**

- ✅ 83% cost reduction vs Azure
- ✅ Git push to deploy (minimal DevOps)
- ✅ Auto-scaling included
- ✅ SSL/TLS auto-managed
- ✅ Monitoring included
- ✅ 99.95% uptime SLA
- ✅ SOC 2, GDPR compliant
- ✅ Preview environments for PRs
- ✅ Zero-downtime deployments
- ✅ Excellent developer experience

**Cons:**

- ⚠️ Less control than Kubernetes
- ⚠️ Vendor lock-in (mitigated by Docker portability)
- ⚠️ Scaling ceiling (~10k users before needing migration)
- ⚠️ Limited customization vs self-hosted

**When to Migrate from Render:**

- 10,000+ daily active users
- Multi-region latency requirements
- Custom networking needs
- Database >500GB
- Compliance requiring specific cloud provider

**Timeline to outgrow Render:** 2-5 years for most legal SaaS platforms

### Environment Variables Strategy

**Render Auto-Injected:**

- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection string
- `RENDER_SERVICE_NAME` - Current service name
- `RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL` - Service public URL
- `RENDER_GIT_COMMIT` - Deployed commit SHA

**Manual Configuration:**

- `NODE_ENV` - production/staging
- `JWT_SECRET` - Authentication secret
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` - Frontend API URL
- `AI_PROVIDER` - Primary AI provider (anthropic)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Claude API key (primary)
- `GROK_API_KEY` - Grok API key (fallback, optional)
- `ANTHROPIC_USE_PROMPT_CACHING` - Enable 90% cost reduction on cached prompts
- `ANTHROPIC_USE_BATCHING` - Enable 50% cost reduction for batch processing
- Service-specific: SMTP credentials, storage keys, etc.

**No Longer Needed (Azure-specific):**

- `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`
- `AZURE_KEY_VAULT_URI`
- `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`
- `AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID`

### Testing Strategy

**Pre-Deployment Testing:**

1. Docker builds locally
2. docker-compose full stack starts
3. All unit tests pass
4. Integration tests with local services
5. E2E tests with Playwright

**Staging Deployment Testing:**

1. Deploy to Render staging
2. Run integration tests against staging
3. Load testing (simulate 100 concurrent users)
4. Database migration testing
5. Rollback testing
6. Monitor for 48 hours

**Production Deployment Testing:**

1. Deploy to Render production
2. Smoke tests (health checks, critical paths)
3. Monitor for 24 hours
4. Performance baseline
5. Cost validation

### Monitoring and Alerting

**New Relic Free Tier (Recommended):**

- 100GB/month data ingestion (free)
- APM for all services
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Custom dashboards
- Alert channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty)

**Render Native Monitoring:**

- CPU/memory metrics
- Request metrics
- Log aggregation (30 days)
- Uptime monitoring
- Deployment history

**Alerts to Configure:**

- Error rate >5% (critical)
- Response time >2s p95 (warning)
- CPU >80% (warning)
- Memory >85% (critical)
- Database connections >80% (warning)
- Redis memory >90% (critical)

### Cost Management

**Budget Alerts:**

- Warning: $230/month (110% of estimate)
- Critical: $250/month (120% of estimate)

**Cost Optimization Opportunities:**

- Right-size instances after 1 month of production data
- Use preview environments sparingly (cost per PR)
- Optimize database queries to avoid scaling up
- Monitor New Relic data ingestion (stay within 100GB free tier)

**Expected Cost Growth:**

- 100 users: $207/month ✓
- 500 users: $300/month (scale up services)
- 1,000 users: $450/month (more instances)
- 5,000 users: $800/month (database scaling)
- 10,000 users: $1,500/month (consider migration)

### Render CLI and Tools

**Render CLI Installation:**

```bash
npm install -g @render/cli
render login
```

**Common Operations:**

```bash
# Deploy
render deploy --service web

# Logs
render logs --service web --tail

# Shell

### Alternative Platforms Considered

| Platform               | Monthly Cost | Pros                              | Cons                    | Decision        |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| **Render**             | $207         | Best DX, auto-scaling, monitoring | Scaling ceiling         | ✅ **Selected** |
| Railway                | $220         | Great monorepo support            | Fewer features          | Considered      |
| Fly.io                 | $280         | Global edge deployment            | Complex pricing         | Considered      |
| Azure (optimized)      | $500         | Full control, enterprise          | Complexity, cost        | ❌ Rejected     |
| AWS                    | $1,450       | Industry standard                 | Expensive, complex      | ❌ Rejected     |
| DigitalOcean + Coolify | $389         | Good control, lower cost          | Self-managed            | Considered      |
| Serverless (Lambda)    | $203         | Pay-per-use                       | Cold starts, complexity | Considered      |

**Decision Rationale:** Render offers the best balance of cost ($207/month), developer experience (git push to deploy), and features (auto-scaling, monitoring, SSL) for a legal platform serving 100-1,000 users initially.

### AI Cost Optimization Strategy

**UPDATE (2025-11-17):** AI provider configuration updated to use Claude (primary) + Grok (fallback) with comprehensive cost optimization.

**AI Provider Architecture:**

- **Primary:** Anthropic Claude (3.5 Haiku, 3.5 Sonnet, 4.1 Opus)
- **Fallback:** xAI Grok (automatic failover if Claude unavailable)
- **Strategy:** Smart model selection + Prompt Caching + Batch API

**Cost Optimization Features Enabled:**

1. **Prompt Caching** (`ANTHROPIC_USE_PROMPT_CACHING=true`)
   - 90% cost reduction on cached tokens
   - Cache TTL: 5 minutes (auto-refreshes)
   - Ideal for: System prompts, legal templates, case law references
   - Example savings: $3.00/MTok → $0.30/MTok (Sonnet)

2. **Batch API** (`ANTHROPIC_USE_BATCHING=true`)
   - 50% cost reduction on batch requests
   - Processing time: <24 hours
   - Ideal for: Document analysis, report generation, compliance checks
   - Example savings: $3.00/MTok → $1.50/MTok (Sonnet)

3. **Smart Model Selection**
   - Haiku (60% of requests): Simple tasks, metadata extraction, email classification
   - Sonnet (35% of requests): Contract review, legal research, document drafting
   - Opus (5% of requests): Complex litigation strategy, multi-document analysis
   - Cost difference: Haiku $0.80/MTok vs Sonnet $3.00/MTok vs Opus $15.00/MTok

4. **Combined Optimization**
   - Prompt Caching + Batch API = **up to 95% cost reduction**
   - Example: 1M tokens cached in batch = $0.90 vs $18.00 standard

**Cost Projections (100 users, 30K requests/month):**

| Optimization Level              | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost | Savings vs Baseline |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------------- |
| No optimization (all Sonnet)    | $1,260       | $15,120     | Baseline            |
| Model selection (60% Haiku)     | $588         | $7,056      | 53%                 |
| + Prompt caching (80% hit rate) | $176         | $2,112      | 86%                 |
| + Batch API (50% eligible)      | $132         | $1,584      | 90%                 |
| **Full optimization**           | **$126**     | **$1,512**  | **90%**             |

**Implementation:**

- Environment configuration updated in Task 5
- Cost optimization guide created: `docs/architecture/claude-cost-optimization.md`
- All environment templates and deployment guides updated
- AI service configuration: `services/ai-service/.env.example`

**Scaling Cost Estimates:**

- 100 users: $126/month (with optimization) vs $1,260/month (without)
- 500 users: $630/month (with optimization) vs $6,300/month (without)
- 1,000 users: $1,260/month (with optimization) vs $12,600/month (without)

**Key Resources:**

- Cost Optimization Guide: `docs/architecture/claude-cost-optimization.md`
- Environment Variables: `infrastructure/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`
- PRD Updated: `docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md`

**Fallback Strategy:**

If Claude experiences downtime or rate limiting:

1. Automatic failover to xAI Grok
2. Grok pricing: ~$5/MTok (comparable to Sonnet)
3. Fallback events logged for monitoring
4. Configuration: `AI_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true`

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929) - Mary (Business Analyst persona)

### Analysis Summary

**Analysis Completed:**

- ✅ Validated Azure cost estimates against market rates
- ✅ Analyzed monitoring cost anomaly (43% of budget, 900% above industry standard)
- ✅ Identified immediate quick-win optimizations ($3,316/month savings on Azure)
- ✅ Compared alternative cloud providers (AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean, Hetzner)
- ✅ Explored alternative architectures (PaaS, serverless, hybrid)
- ✅ Calculated 3-year TCO including DevOps costs
- ✅ Created strategic recommendations with ROI analysis

**Key Findings:**

1. Azure monitoring costs are wildly excessive ($1,782/month vs $200 industry standard)
2. Render offers 83% cost savings vs Azure ($2,484/year vs $14,268/year)
3. Platform-as-a-Service has lowest TCO when including DevOps time
4. Greenfield deployment eliminates migration risk and cost
5. Can migrate away from Render later if needed (Docker portability)

**Recommendation:** Deploy to Render.com immediately. This decision is optimal for a legal platform in the early stages with expected 100-1,000 users initially.
