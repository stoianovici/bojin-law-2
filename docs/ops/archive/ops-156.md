# OPS-156: Fix cases-status-overview date filtering

| Field        | Value                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Status**   | Resolved                                   |
| **Type**     | Bug                                        |
| **Priority** | P2-Medium                                  |
| **Created**  | 2025-12-24                                 |
| **Resolved** | 2025-12-24                                 |
| **Epic**     | Reports Data Accuracy (OPS-156 to OPS-161) |

## Problem

The `cases-status-overview` report showed 0 cases because `queryCases()` always filtered by `openedDate` within the selected date range. However, this report has `requiresDateRange: false` - it should show ALL non-archived cases grouped by status, not just those opened this month.

## Root Cause

In `report-data.service.ts`, the `queryCases()` method applied date filtering unconditionally:

```typescript
if (filters?.dateRange || dateRange) {
  const range = filters?.dateRange || dateRange;
  where.openedDate = {
    gte: range.start,
    lte: range.end,
  };
}
```

Since a default date range is always passed, all cases were filtered even when not needed.

## Solution

1. Added `getCasesByStatus()` method that doesn't filter by date - groups all non-archived cases by status
2. Routed `cases-status-overview` to this method in the resolver switch

## Files Changed

- `services/gateway/src/services/report-data.service.ts` - Added `getCasesByStatus()` method
- `services/gateway/src/graphql/resolvers/reports.resolvers.ts` - Added routing for `cases-status-overview`

## Done

- [x] cases-status-overview shows all 6 cases (not filtered by date)
- [x] Chart displays correct status distribution (shows "Activ" status)
- [x] Tested in browser - verified Total: 6 displayed
