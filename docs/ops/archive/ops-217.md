# OPS-217: Remove Case Modals & Update Entry Points

**Type**: Refactor | **Priority**: P2-Medium | **Complexity**: S
**Status**: Closed

## Problem

Old modals need removal, entry points need updating to new flow.

## Solution

Deleted modal files and updated entry points to use navigation to `/cases/new`.

### Files Deleted

```
apps/web/src/components/case/CreateCaseModal.tsx
apps/web/src/components/case/CreateCaseModal.test.tsx
apps/web/src/components/case/EditCaseModal.tsx
```

### Entry Points Updated

1. **Cases List Page** (`apps/web/src/app/cases/page.tsx`)
   - Changed "+ Dosar nou" button from modal trigger to `<Link href="/cases/new">`
   - Updated both main toolbar and empty state buttons

2. **Case Workspace Page** (`apps/web/src/app/cases/[caseId]/page.tsx`)
   - Removed `EditCaseModal` import
   - Removed `editCaseModalOpen` state
   - Removed modal rendering
   - Edit functionality now handled by CaseHeader edit toggle (OPS-215)

### Kept

- `ReviewCaseModal` - different workflow (Partner approval)
