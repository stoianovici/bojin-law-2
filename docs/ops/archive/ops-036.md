# OPS-036: Simplify /communications UI

**Status:** Open | **Priority:** P2-Medium | **Type:** Feature | **Created:** 2025-12-18

## Overview

Remove unnecessary UI elements from `/communications` to prepare for the redesign. This is a cleanup issue that can proceed independently.

## Dependencies

- **Depends on:** None
- **Blocks:** OPS-041
- **Parallel with:** OPS-035, OPS-037

## Context

Part of the Communications Architecture Rethink. The current `/communications` page has several panels and features that will not be part of the new design:

- Extracted items panel (Elemente extrase)
- AI response suggestion panel (Sugestie răspuns AI) - keep functionality in reply composer only
- Filters (Doar necitite, Cu termene, Cu atașamente)
- Thread list limited to 20 items

## Requirements

### 1. Remove Extracted Items Panel

- Delete `ExtractedItemsPanel` from the page
- Keep the component file for now (may be used elsewhere)

### 2. Remove AI Suggestion Panel

- Remove `AIDraftResponsePanel` from the main view
- **Keep AI functionality in the reply/compose flow** - when user clicks "Răspunde", AI can still suggest responses
- This is about removing the always-visible panel, not the feature

### 3. Remove Filters

- Remove `FilterBar` component from the page
- Remove filter state management
- Threads will be organized by case in the redesign (OPS-041)

### 4. Improve Thread List

- Remove 20-thread limit
- Implement proper infinite scroll / pagination
- Ensure smooth scrolling with many threads

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Extracted items panel removed from /communications
- [ ] AI suggestion panel removed from main view
- [ ] AI assist still works in compose/reply modal
- [ ] Filter bar removed
- [ ] Thread list shows more than 20 threads with infinite scroll
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Page still functional for email viewing and composing

## Files to Modify

- `apps/web/src/app/communications/page.tsx` - main changes
- `apps/web/src/hooks/useEmailSync.ts` - remove filter logic if embedded
- Related components in `apps/web/src/components/communication/`

## Estimated Scope

Medium - UI removal + pagination improvement.
