# OPS-288: Add Email Folder Fields to Schema

**Type**: Data Model | **Priority**: P1-High | **Complexity**: S
**Status**: Open
**Parallel**: Yes (Phase 1)
**Epic**: Sync All Outlook Folders

## Problem

Email model only has `folderType` ('inbox' | 'sent'). Need to store actual Outlook folder info for emails in user-created folders like "Clients", "Archive", etc.

## Approach

Add two fields to Email model:

- `parentFolderId` - Graph API folder ID (for API operations)
- `parentFolderName` - Display name ("Inbox", "Client Emails", "Archive")

## Done When

- [x] Schema updated with new fields
- [x] Migration created and tested
- [x] Prisma client regenerated

## Files

- `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma`
- `packages/database/prisma/migrations/20251227100000_add_email_folder_fields/`

## Session Log

- 2025-12-27: Issue created as part of Outlook Folders epic
- 2025-12-27: Verified schema changes, added @@index on parentFolderName, migration applied, Prisma client regenerated - **DONE**
