# OPS-198: Remove ClassificationModal

**Status:** Resolved | **Priority:** P2-Medium | **Type:** Feature | **Created:** 2025-12-24

## Overview

Delete the ClassificationModal component and related code, now that inline assignment (OPS-196) is the new approach.

## Dependencies

- **Depends on:** OPS-196 (inline assignment must be working)
- **Blocks:** None
- **Parallel with:** OPS-197

## Context

Part of Communications UX Overhaul epic. The ClassificationModal was created in OPS-042 for handling NECLAR emails. It's now being replaced by inline assignment buttons in the email view.

## Requirements

### 1. Delete Components

- `apps/web/src/components/communication/ClassificationModal.tsx`

### 2. Update Hooks

Review and update/delete:

- `apps/web/src/hooks/useClassifyEmail.ts`

The hook may have useful mutations that can be reused. If so, rename and refactor rather than delete.

### 3. Remove Imports

Update all files that import ClassificationModal:

- `apps/web/src/app/communications/page.tsx`
- Any other files

### 4. Clean Up GraphQL

If there are GraphQL operations only used by ClassificationModal:

- Consider keeping them for inline assignment
- Or update names to reflect new usage

### 5. Verification

After deletion:

- No import errors
- NECLAR flow uses inline assignment
- All tests pass

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] ClassificationModal.tsx deleted
- [x] useClassifyEmail.ts updated or deleted
- [x] No import errors in codebase
- [x] NECLAR emails handled by inline assignment
- [x] No dead code remaining
- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors

## Files to Delete/Modify

- `apps/web/src/components/communication/ClassificationModal.tsx` (DELETE)
- `apps/web/src/hooks/useClassifyEmail.ts` (DELETE or REFACTOR)
- `apps/web/src/app/communications/page.tsx` (MODIFY)

## Estimated Scope

Small - Cleanup task.

## Session Log

### 2025-12-24

**Completed cleanup:**

1. Deleted `apps/web/src/components/communication/ClassificationModal.tsx`
2. Deleted `apps/web/src/hooks/useClassifyEmail.ts` - no longer used since:
   - ConversationView.tsx has its own inline `CLASSIFY_UNCERTAIN_EMAIL` mutation
   - SplitAssignmentButton handles the UI for inline assignment
3. Removed obsolete comments from `apps/web/src/app/communications/page.tsx`
4. Verified TypeScript compiles without errors
5. Confirmed no remaining imports of deleted files

**Notes:**

- SplitAssignmentButton.tsx has a comment referencing ClassificationModal in its docstring (explains what it replaces) - left as-is for context
