# OPS-224: Fix Case Number Field Label

**Type**: Bug
**Priority**: P2-Medium
**Status**: Resolved
**Created**: 2025-12-25

## Problem

The `caseNumber` field in CaseDetailsSection displays "Nr. Dosar Instanță" (court case number) but this field stores the **internal firm reference** (e.g., "BL-2024-001"). Court case numbers should be added via ReferencesSection which already supports "Nr. Dosar Instanță" as a reference type.

This creates confusion for users who may enter court file numbers in the wrong field.

## Solution

Change the label to "Număr Intern" and update the placeholder to reflect internal reference format.

## Implementation

1. Update label in CaseDetailsSection.tsx from "Nr. Dosar Instanță" to "Număr Intern"
2. Update placeholder from "ex: 1234/5/2024" to "ex: BL-2024-001"
3. CaseHeader badge remains unchanged (displays caseNumber without label)

## Files to Modify

- `apps/web/src/components/case/sections/CaseDetailsSection.tsx` - lines 179-187

## Done When

- [x] Label changed from "Nr. Dosar Instanță" to "Număr Intern"
- [x] Placeholder changed from "ex: 1234/5/2024" to "ex: BL-2024-001"
- [x] Verified in browser that label displays correctly
- [x] No TypeScript errors

## Notes

- This is a UI-only change, no backend modifications needed
- The ReferencesSection already correctly handles court file numbers as "Nr. Dosar Instanță"
