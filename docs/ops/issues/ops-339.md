# OPS-339: Shared Component Audit (Card, Modal)

**Type**: Discovery | **Priority**: P2-Medium | **Platform**: Both | **Status**: Complete
**Parent**: [OPS-338](ops-338.md) | **Blocked by**: None | **Parallel**: Yes

## Problem

Two shared components from `packages/ui` use heavy shadows that don't align with Linear's minimal aesthetic:

- **Card** (elevated variant): Uses `shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl`
- **Modal**: Uses `shadow-2xl`

These components are used across the entire app, so fixing them has high impact.

## Scope

| Component | File                                  | Current Issue                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Card      | `packages/ui/src/atoms/Card.tsx`      | `shadow-lg`, `shadow-xl` on elevated variant |
| Modal     | `packages/ui/src/molecules/Modal.tsx` | `shadow-2xl` on content                      |

## Approach

Audit both components and document:

1. Current shadow/border classes used (with line numbers)
2. Target Linear token replacements
3. All consumer pages/components (impact analysis)
4. Dark mode considerations

## Deliverable

Create `docs/design/ui-adaptation/audit/components.md` with:

```markdown
# Shared Component Audit

## Card Component

**File**: `packages/ui/src/atoms/Card.tsx`

### Current State

- Line XX: `shadow-lg` on elevated variant
- Line XX: `hover:shadow-xl` on elevated hover

### Target State

- Replace with `shadow-sm` / `hover:shadow-md`
- Or use Linear tokens: `shadow-linear-subtle`

### Consumers

- Dashboard widgets (PartnerDashboard, AssociateDashboard)
- Case cards
- Settings panels
- ...

## Modal Component

**File**: `packages/ui/src/molecules/Modal.tsx`

### Current State

- Line XX: `shadow-2xl` on content wrapper

### Target State

- Replace with `shadow-lg` or `shadow-linear-elevated`

### Consumers

- All modal dialogs across app
- ...
```

## Audit Checklist

- [ ] Document current shadow classes with line numbers
- [ ] Map to Linear shadow tokens
- [ ] Check border styling (should use `border-linear-subtle`)
- [ ] Verify background colors align with tokens
- [ ] List all consumer pages/components
- [ ] Note dark mode considerations
- [ ] Check for variant-specific issues

## Done When

- [x] `docs/design/ui-adaptation/audit/components.md` created
- [x] All shadow classes documented with line numbers
- [x] Target replacements specified
- [x] Consumer impact analysis complete

## Estimated Effort

2-3 hours

## Notes

This is the **recommended starting point** for the discovery phase because:

1. Smallest scope (2 files)
2. Informs other audits (pages use these components)
3. Can be completed in a single session
