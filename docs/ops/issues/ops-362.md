**Type**: Feature | **Priority**: P2-Medium | **Platform**: Desktop | **Status**: Verifying
**Parent**: [OPS-338](ops-338.md) | **Phase**: 5 (More Pages)
**Blocked by**: OPS-349, OPS-352, OPS-353

## Problem

Time tracking page needs week picker, grouped table by day, daily/weekly totals.

## Approach

- Create TimeTrackingPage with period selector
- Create TimeEntryTable grouped by date
- Add AddTimeEntryModal
- Show totals row

## Done When

- [x] Page header with "Adaugă timp" button
- [x] Week picker for period selection
- [x] TimeEntryTable: grouped by day with daily totals
- [x] Columns: case, activity, hours, billable status
- [x] Weekly total display
- [x] AddTimeEntryModal: case, description, hours, date, billable toggle
- [x] TimeEntryRow: inline edit, quick delete

## Implementation

Created `/pontaj` page with full Linear-style time tracking:

- `WeekPicker` component for period navigation with prev/next/today
- `WeeklyTotals` summary showing total, billable, and non-billable hours
- `GroupedTable` grouped by day showing all 7 days of the week
- Custom group headers showing day label, entry count, and daily total
- `AddTimeEntryModal` with case selector, date, hours increment buttons, description, billable toggle
- `EditTimeEntryModal` for updating existing entries
- Delete with confirmation dialog
- Row hover actions for edit/delete
