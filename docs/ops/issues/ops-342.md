# OPS-342: HTML Mockups & Consolidation

**Type**: Discovery | **Priority**: P2-Medium | **Platform**: Both | **Status**: Complete
**Parent**: [OPS-338](ops-338.md) | **Blocked by**: OPS-339, OPS-340, OPS-341 | **Parallel**: No

## Problem

After the audit phase, we need visual mockups to:

1. Validate the target design before implementation
2. Provide clear reference for implementation
3. Enable stakeholder review

## Prerequisites

This issue cannot start until all audit issues are complete:

- [ ] OPS-339: Shared Component Audit - provides component targets
- [ ] OPS-340: Page Audit - Desktop Styling - provides page targets
- [ ] OPS-341: Page Audit - Mobile Responsiveness - provides mobile targets

## Scope

Create HTML mockups for the most significant changes identified in the audits.

### Required Mockups

| Mockup                       | Purpose                        | Source  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------- |
| `403-page.html`              | Error page with Linear styling | OPS-340 |
| `cases-new-desktop.html`     | Form page with Linear tokens   | OPS-340 |
| `cases-new-mobile.html`      | Mobile-optimized form layout   | OPS-341 |
| `card-modal-components.html` | Updated shared components      | OPS-339 |

### Optional Mockups (based on audit findings)

- Additional pages with significant changes
- Before/after comparisons

## Approach

1. Review all audit documents
2. Create standalone HTML files using Linear tokens from `docs/design/linear-style-tokens.md`
3. Focus on the **changes**, not full page recreation
4. Include dark mode variants where relevant

## Deliverables

### Directory Structure

```
docs/design/ui-adaptation/mockups/
├── 403-page.html
├── cases-new-desktop.html
├── cases-new-mobile.html
└── card-modal-components.html
```

### Mockup Requirements

Each mockup should:

- Use CSS variables from existing Linear token definitions
- Be self-contained (inline styles or embedded CSS)
- Show the target state clearly
- Include comments explaining key changes
- Work when opened directly in browser

### Example Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" class="dark">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>403 Page - Linear Style Target</title>
    <style>
      :root {
        --linear-bg-primary: #0a0a0b;
        --linear-text-primary: #eeeff1;
        --linear-accent: #5e6ad2;
        /* ... other tokens */
      }
      /* Component styles */
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Target design -->
  </body>
</html>
```

### Consolidation Tasks

1. Update `docs/design/ui-adaptation/audit/` files with any corrections
2. Cross-reference mockups with audit findings
3. Ensure consistency across all mockups

## Done When

- [x] All required mockups created in `docs/design/ui-adaptation/mockups/`
- [x] Mockups use Linear design tokens
- [x] Mockups are self-contained and viewable in browser
- [x] Audit documents reviewed and updated if needed
- [x] Mockups validated against audit findings

## Estimated Effort

4-6 hours

## Notes

- Reference existing mockups at `docs/design/linear-style-mockup.html`
- Keep mockups minimal - focus on changed elements
- Consider using Tailwind Play or similar for rapid prototyping
- Mockups don't need to be pixel-perfect, just clear enough for implementation
