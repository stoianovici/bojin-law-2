# OPS-364: Settings Page

**Type**: Feature | **Priority**: P2-Medium | **Platform**: Desktop | **Status**: Verifying
**Parent**: [OPS-338](ops-338.md) | **Phase**: 6 (Admin & Settings)
**Blocked by**: OPS-346, OPS-349

## Problem

Settings page needs sidebar navigation with section content areas.

## Approach

- Create SettingsPage with section sidebar
- Implement ProfileSettings, FirmSettings, IntegrationSettings, TeamSettings, BillingSettings
- Use form components from Phase 1

## Done When

- [x] Settings sidebar with section links
- [x] Content area for active section
- [x] ProfileSettings: avatar, name, email, notifications
- [x] FirmSettings (admin): firm name, logo, address, invoice format
- [x] IntegrationSettings: Microsoft 365 status, sync settings
- [x] TeamSettings (admin): member list, invite, roles
- [x] BillingSettings (admin): hourly rates, tax, payment terms

## Files

- `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/setari/page.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/settings-v2/` - New Linear-style components

## Implementation Notes

- Created new `/setari` page with sidebar navigation
- Dynamic imports for each settings section (lazy loading)
- Role-based section visibility (admin-only sections hidden for non-Partners)
- URL query param based navigation (`?section=profile`)
- Old `/settings/*` routes redirect to new location
- Reused existing `useDefaultRates` hook for billing settings
- All UI text in Romanian
