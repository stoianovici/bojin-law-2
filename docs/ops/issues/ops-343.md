# OPS-343: Generate Implementation Plan

**Type**: Discovery | **Priority**: P2-Medium | **Platform**: Both | **Status**: Open
**Parent**: [OPS-338](ops-338.md) | **Blocked by**: OPS-342 | **Parallel**: No

## Problem

After discovery is complete, we need a prioritized implementation plan that:

1. Groups work logically for efficient execution
2. Prioritizes by user impact
3. Accounts for dependencies (shared components first)
4. Provides clear scope for each implementation issue

## Prerequisites

This issue cannot start until mockups are complete:

- [ ] OPS-342: HTML Mockups & Consolidation

## Input Artifacts

- `docs/design/ui-adaptation/audit/components.md` (from OPS-339)
- `docs/design/ui-adaptation/audit/pages.md` (from OPS-340)
- `docs/design/ui-adaptation/audit/mobile.md` (from OPS-341)
- `docs/design/ui-adaptation/mockups/*.html` (from OPS-342)

## Approach

1. Analyze all audit findings
2. Identify natural groupings (by component, by page, by complexity)
3. Determine dependencies (shared components must be done first)
4. Prioritize by user impact
5. Generate implementation issue recommendations

## Deliverables

### 1. Epic README

Update `docs/design/ui-adaptation/README.md` with:

- Discovery summary
- Status tracker
- Links to all artifacts
- Implementation phase overview

### 2. Implementation Plan

Create `docs/design/ui-adaptation/implementation-plan.md`:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan

## Discovery Summary

- Pages audited: X
- Components audited: X
- Total estimated changes: X
- Mockups created: X

## Recommended Issue Breakdown

### Phase A: Shared Components (Do First)

**Rationale**: Fixing shared components first prevents duplicate work and ensures consistency.

#### Issue: Update Card/Modal Shadows

- **Files**: 2
- **Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours
- **Changes**:
  - `packages/ui/src/atoms/Card.tsx`: Lines X, Y, Z
  - `packages/ui/src/molecules/Modal.tsx`: Line X
- **Testing**: Verify across all consuming pages

---

### Phase B: High-Traffic Pages

**Rationale**: User-facing pages should be fixed before admin pages.

#### Issue: Cases Pages Styling

- **Files**: X
- **Estimated Effort**: X hours
- **Scope**: `/cases/new`, `/cases/[id]`
- **Changes**: [summary from audit]

#### Issue: Cases New Mobile Responsiveness

- **Files**: 1
- **Estimated Effort**: X hours
- **Approach**: [from OPS-341 recommendation]

---

### Phase C: Secondary Pages

...

### Phase D: Admin Pages (Lower Priority)

...

---

## Execution Order
```

Phase A (do first):
└── Shared Components

Phase B (after A, parallel):
├── Cases Pages Styling
├── Cases Mobile
└── Time Tracking Mobile

Phase C (after B):
├── Secondary Pages
└── ...

Phase D (last):
└── Admin Pages

```

## Risk Assessment
- [any risks identified during discovery]

## Testing Strategy
- [how to verify changes]
```

## Done When

- [ ] `docs/design/ui-adaptation/README.md` updated with complete epic overview
- [ ] `docs/design/ui-adaptation/implementation-plan.md` created
- [ ] All implementation issues recommended with clear scope
- [ ] Priority and dependencies documented
- [ ] Ready to create implementation issues via `/ops-new`

## Estimated Effort

2-3 hours

## Next Steps After This Issue

Once this issue is complete, use the implementation plan to:

1. Create implementation issues via `/ops-new [description from plan]`
2. Or batch create via `/ops-draft` with the plan as input
3. Begin implementation work

## Notes

- **Do not pre-define implementation issues** - they should emerge from actual findings
- Consider grouping by:
  - Shared components (highest leverage)
  - High-traffic pages (highest user impact)
  - Complexity (simple fixes vs complex refactors)
  - Platform (desktop vs mobile)
- The plan should be actionable - each recommended issue should have clear scope
