# OPS-323: Desktop Structural Components (linear/)

**Status**: Done
**Priority**: P1-High
**Type**: Feature
**Platform**: Desktop
**Parent**: OPS-322
**Blocked by**: None

## Problem Statement

Linear design mockup defines structural patterns (PageLayout, SectionHeader, ListItem, MetricCard, etc.) that don't exist as reusable components. Pages must be migrated to use these patterns, but the components need to be built first.

---

## Approach

Create `apps/web/src/components/linear/` component library matching mockup patterns:

### Components to Build

| Component           | Purpose                                      | Reference                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `PageLayout.tsx`    | Standard page wrapper with proper bg/spacing | `.dashboard` in mockup     |
| `SectionHeader.tsx` | 11px uppercase section titles                | `.nav-section-title`       |
| `ListItem.tsx`      | Case/task row with hover states              | `.list-item`, `.case-item` |
| `MetricCard.tsx`    | Value + label + trend indicator              | `.metric-item`             |
| `WidgetGrid.tsx`    | 2-3 column responsive grid                   | `.widget-grid`             |
| `StatusDot.tsx`     | Colored dot with optional pulse              | `.status-dot`              |
| `FilterChips.tsx`   | Inline filter row                            | Card header filters        |

### Design Tokens (already in Tailwind)

```
bg-linear-bg-primary (#0A0A0B)
bg-linear-bg-secondary (#111113)
text-linear-text-primary (#EEEFF1)
text-linear-text-secondary (#A1A1AA)
text-linear-text-tertiary (#71717A)
bg-linear-accent (#5E6AD2)
border-linear-subtle (rgba(255,255,255,0.06))
```

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All 7 components built matching mockup exactly
- [x] Components use Linear tokens from Tailwind config
- [x] TypeScript interfaces exported for all props
- [x] Components follow existing codebase patterns (`'use client'`, clsx, etc.)
- [x] Hover/focus states match mockup

---

## Key Files

- `apps/web/src/components/linear/*.tsx` (new)
- `docs/design/linear-style-mockup.html` (reference)
- `docs/design/linear-style-tokens.md` (reference)
- `apps/web/tailwind.config.js` (tokens already defined)

---

## Notes

- This is a prerequisite for OPS-326 (Desktop Page Migration)
- Components should be generic enough to use across multiple pages
- Match the HTML structure from mockup as closely as possible
