# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Romanian Legal Practice Management Platform**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on reviewing the PRD, I see:
- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo specified (PRD line 127)
- **Service Architecture:** Microservices within Monorepo (PRD lines 133-138)
- No specific starter template is mentioned - this appears to be a greenfield project
