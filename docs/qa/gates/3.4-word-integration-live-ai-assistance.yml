nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Lock token generation uses cryptographically secure randomBytes(32). Access control properly validates firm membership. SSO token exchange documented. Webhook clientState validation implemented."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "30-second sync interval implemented per requirements. Lock acquisition uses Redis for <500ms response. AI add-in caches completion suggestions with 2-minute TTL. Polling for Word selection changes is an Office.js limitation."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Dual-storage lock pattern (Redis + PostgreSQL) provides reliability. retryWithBackoff used for Graph API calls. Lock cleanup worker handles expired locks. Graceful degradation in track changes parsing."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of concerns with dedicated services. Well-documented code with JSDoc comments. TypeScript types in shared package. Singleton patterns for service instances."
