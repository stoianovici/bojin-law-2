nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Firm isolation enforced at resolver level via Prisma filters
      - Role-based access enforced at directive level
      - Unauthorized access logged with full context (userId, firmId, role, field, timestamp)
      - GraphQL errors use proper codes (FORBIDDEN, UNAUTHENTICATED)
      - Cross-firm access prevented by getFinancialDataFilter utility
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Role check is O(1) string comparison
      - Prisma filter construction is lightweight
      - Context population happens once per request
      - No database queries added to authorization path
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Graceful degradation: unauthorized field access returns null instead of errors
      - Comprehensive error handling with proper GraphQL error codes
      - 59 tests covering all edge cases and role combinations
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Clean separation of concerns (directive, utilities, context, hooks)
      - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation
      - Follows existing patterns from Story 2.8.3
      - TypeScript types properly defined and exported
