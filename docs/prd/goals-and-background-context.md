# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable law firms to increase billable hours by 20% through AI-powered automation of administrative tasks
- Reduce document error rates by 75% using AI-assisted drafting and semantic version control
- Achieve 2+ hour daily time savings per user through natural language interfaces and intelligent task management
- Deliver unified workspace eliminating tool fragmentation across email, documents, tasks, and communications
- Provide real-time visibility into firm operations with role-based dashboards and automatic time tracking
- Create AI knowledge base that continuously learns from firm documents to improve suggestions and drafting
- Support Romanian legal workflows with full Romanian language support and local legal terminology
- Enable proactive legal practice through AI that anticipates needs, suggests actions, and identifies missing information

## Background Context

Romanian law firms currently operate with fragmented tools that create costly inefficiencies—lawyers lose 2-3 billable hours daily to administrative tasks, document errors require court corrections in ~5% of filings, and 20-30% of billable time is never captured. Unlike traditional legal software that adds AI as an afterthought, this platform embeds intelligence at every interaction layer through a conversational-first interface where natural language drives complex inputs while maintaining visual dashboards for rapid information consumption. The AI doesn't just respond to commands—it anticipates needs based on full case context, suggests next actions proactively, and continuously learns from every document the firm creates, becoming an intelligent team member that never forgets a detail or misses a deadline.
