## Architect Prompt

Using the Romanian Legal Practice Management Platform PRD, design the technical architecture for a microservices-based legal platform within a monorepo structure, implementing: Microsoft Graph API integration for full Outlook/OneDrive/Calendar synchronization with 95%+ success rate; multi-model AI routing (Claude Haiku/Sonnet/Opus) with token cost tracking under €40/user/month; PostgreSQL with pgvector for semantic search and Redis for caching; real-time bidirectional sync with conflict resolution; Azure cloud deployment using AKS with EU data residency; GraphQL API with WebSocket support for real-time features; and ensure sub-2-second page loads for 100+ concurrent users while maintaining 99.9% uptime during business hours and full GDPR compliance.

## UX Expert Prompt

Review the Romanian Legal Practice Management Platform PRD and create comprehensive UX/UI designs for an AI-native legal platform with these key requirements: design a natural language-first interface where lawyers can use conversational inputs for complex tasks while maintaining structured visual outputs for rapid information consumption; ensure WCAG AA accessibility compliance with special attention to Romanian diacritic support; create role-specific dashboards for Partners, Associates, and Paralegals that surface AI suggestions proactively; design the dual-mode document editor with AI assistance panel; and optimize the command palette (Cmd+K) interaction pattern for legal workflows.
